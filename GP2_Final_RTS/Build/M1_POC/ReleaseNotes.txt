	Errors:
	-Units are using raycast and doesn't perfectly "see" enemy units in front, so some enemies
	will just walk past.
	-Didn't code the attackBuilding state properly. Sometimes the units will not attack all buildings
	due to errors.
	-Units may just walk past everything and go the edge of the map.
